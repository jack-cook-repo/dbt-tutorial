      description:  > 
        Distance between the start and end stations in km, calculated by Manhattan distance,
        which is:
        - The absolute difference between the latitude co-ordinates * 111km, plus 
        - The cosine of the latitude (in radians) * 111km * the absolute difference in longitude

        - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
            expression: '>= 0'

    - name: journey_distance_direct_km
      description: >
        Distance between the start and end stations in km, calculated as a direct distance
        using BigQuery's ST_DISTANCE function.

        In cases where this is greater than the journey_distance_manhattan, due to edge cases
        where a straight line distance is calculated as having a slightly lower Manhattan
        distance because of small inaccuracies in our assumptions, we take the value for 
        journey_distance_direct_km.

        This discrepancy, when assessed, was a maximum of 20 metres.
      tests:
         - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
            expression: '<= journey_distance_manhattan_km'
