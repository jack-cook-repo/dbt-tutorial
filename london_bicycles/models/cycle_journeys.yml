        metabase.caveats: >
          In cases where this is greater than the journey_distance_manhattan, due to edge cases
          where a straight line distance is calculated as having a slightly lower Manhattan
          distance because of small inaccuracies in our assumptions, we take the value for 
          journey_distance_direct_km.

          This discrepancy, when assessed, was a maximum of 20 metres.
      tests:
        - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
            expression: '<= journey_distance_manhattan_km'
